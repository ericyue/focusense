Versioning
For transparency and insight into our release cycle, and for striving to maintain backwards compatibility, Focusense will be maintained under the Semantic Versioning guidelines as much as possible.

Releases will be numbered with the follow format:

<major>.<minor>.<patch>

And constructed with the following guidelines:

Breaking backwards compatibility bumps the major
New additions without breaking backwards compatibility bumps the minor
Bug fixes and misc changes bump the patch
For more information on SemVer, please visit http://semver.org/.
